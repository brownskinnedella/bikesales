# bikesales
In this project, I used Excel to clean and analyze bike sales data from a bike store, transforming raw data into actionable insights. I designed an interactive dashboard to visualize key trends and performance metrics. Key skills demonstrated include VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, and advanced charting techniques.
